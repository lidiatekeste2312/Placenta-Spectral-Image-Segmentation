# Methods to read and write spectral tiff image cubes.
#
# Part of our UEF Computational Spectral Imaging group has been advocating
# Tiff file format for spectral image storage. The main benefit of this
# multipage image format is that it is widely supported. This means that
# the file managers of the major operating systems can show a thumbnail
# preview of the first page in the Tiff image file. The format also allows
# the use of custom tags in the file descriptor metadata. This allows the
# group to embed the center wavelength list of the spectral image bands
# among other metadata.
#
# The spectral image tiffs the group produces have following layout:
#   1st page: RGB render of the spectral image cube under D65 illuminant,
#   2nd page - nth page: the band images of the spectral image cube.
# Tiff tag 65000 contains the wavelength band center wavelengths as a list of
# 32-bit floating point values.
# Tiff tag 65111 contains free-form metadata of the imaging conditions,
# sample, etc., as an ASCII string.
#
# This file also contains two functions, read_mtiff and write_mtiff, for
# storage and retrieval of mask bitmaps. Each page of the tiff file contains
# a bitmap image of an annotation mask, and each page is associated with
# tiff tag 65001 containing the mask label string, again as an ASCII string.
#
# The read_stiff and write_stiff methods provided in this file are based on
# the tifffile-package. The older read_tiff and write_tiff were utilizing
# the same package, but it was embedded in scikit-image. The scikit-image
# package in turn has heavy dependencies, which make it unsuitable in
# certain environments. The tifffile package on the other hand is much
# lighter and more suitable in small environments.
#
# Tifffile package changed how Tiff tags are exposed in version 2020.2.16.
# This version has not made its way into the main repositories in Anaconda
# distribution, but it is available in the conda-forge repository.
# Installation instructions for Anaconda:
#   conda install -c conda-forge tifffile=2020.2.16
#
# Alternatively, recreate the virtual environment suitable for using these
# functions with pipenv:
#   pipenv install
#
# 2021-03-10: read_mtiff, write_mtiff can deal with preview images.
#             read_stiff does not explode on an empty metadata string.
# 2020-06-25: Add read_mtiff, write_mtiff for reading and writing mask bitmaps.
# 2020-06-02: Add rgb_only-parameter to allow loading of the RGB-render only.
# 2020-05-27: Add silent-parameter to silence warnings about duplicate
#             metadata and wavelength lists.
# 2020-03-26: Initial version of the read_stiff and write_stiff functions
#             based on the previous read_tiff and write_tiff functions by
#             Pauli Fält and myself.
